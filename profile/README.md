# discord-trolling (deprecated)
An ecosystem of tools and libraries to simplify the Discord API. Deprecated in favor of https://github.com/ferretcode/goated

## the tools we make
- [discord-trolling](https://github.com/discord-trolling/discord-trolling) a library for making discord bots easy
- [discord-trolling-cli](https://github.com/discord-trolling/discord-trolling-cli) the CLI for interacting with your bots & plugins
- [troll](https://github.com/discord-trolling/troll) a file format with JSON syntax for configuring your bots & commands
- [create-discord-trolling-app](https://github.com/discord-trolling/create-discord-trolling-app) a CLI tool for easily generating projects using templates
- [discord-trolling-plugins](https://github.com/discord-trolling/plugins) a repository containing plugins to extend discord-trolling

## why we did it
We thought discord.js was annoying and slow to work with, but it was the best option out there for making bots. So we took discord.js and simplified it to make it a pleasurable and simple experience.
